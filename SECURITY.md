## Security Best Practices

Django Project Template generates projects with security best practices by default:

- ✅ Django's `check --deploy` runs in CI
- ✅ HSTS, secure cookies, CSP headers enabled in production
- ✅ Dependencies scanned with `pip-audit` and `safety`
- ✅ Container images scanned with Trivy
- ✅ No secrets in repository (environment-based config)
- ✅ SOPS for encrypted secrets (optional)

For enhanced security, use `security_profile: strict` when generating your project.

## Disclosure Policy

When we receive a security report:

1. We confirm the vulnerability and determine severity
2. We develop and test a fix
3. We release a patch version
4. We publicly disclose the vulnerability 7 days after the patch release
